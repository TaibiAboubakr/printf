# Printf project

## Description

This is a group project to implement a custom printf function in C programming language. The goal of this project is to create a function that
produces output similar to the standard C library printf function allowing users to print formatted text to the console or other output stream

The _printf project is divided into many files : the printf.c file, which contains the implementation of the _printf function, and the main.h
file, which contains the function prototype and other files that contains other functions used for formatting outputs.
